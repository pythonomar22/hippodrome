# Hippodrome

Invented in the early 2000s, Hippodrome was invented as a single-player chess variant out of a need to remediate chess' "obstruction of elegance."

The game starts off with the four knights placed along the bottom row of a 4x4 chess board, and the rest of the twelve non-pawn pieces placed in a random
fashion. One of the twelve non-pawn pieces is then removed randomly. The objective of the game is to line all of the four knights to the opposite side/row of the board.
There are no captures, checks, or stalemates. All pieces move as usual. 

As of now, the game is not fully completed. One can play the game, but there is no event when the user "beats" or "solves" the puzzle. There is no backend, as is currently hosted by Netlify.
